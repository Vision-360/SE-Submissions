# Vision 360

There has been a sharp rise in the amount of disruptive and offensive activities in the past decade that makes security a significant concern. Public places like shopping centres, hospitals, banks and even neighbourhoods are increasingly being equipped with CCTVs to guarantee the security of individuals. Subsequently, this inconvenience demands we computerize and analyse this system with high accuracy. Since constant observation of these surveillance cameras is a near-impossible task for us human beings. It requires a work model that gives constant attention and is able to analyse in depth, if the captured activities are anomalous or suspicious. Hence, the need to automate this process with high precision arises. Therefore, to reduce the wastage of time and labour, we have come up with our project VISION 360 that utilizes deep learning algorithms for smart activity detection and other forms of motion detection. One of its many goals is to automatically identify signs of aggression and violence in real-time and filter out irregularities from normal patterns. We plan to use different Deep Learning models to identify and classify various levels of high movement in the frame that can raise a detection alert for the situation of a threat, indicating the suspicious activities at an instance of time. The user is required to register on our website using their email ids and the user can give video inputs in our video feed. The website can also be connected to CCTVs to where we intend to extract frames from the captured CCTV recordings which can thereafter be analysed and classified by various training models. Some of these models include Facial Recognition, Motion Detection and Activity Detection Models. In case something out of the normal is detected, a mail alert would be sent to the concerned user. We plan on utilizing tools such as machine learning, deep learning and various web development techniques. One of the greatest benefits of an intelligent machine is that it would never betray you. In todayâ€™s world of uncertainty and lurking dangers, choose VISION 360 to help you ensure safety of your space.
